## Overview

Please note that this version is unpolished and may contain bugs. It is more of a proof of concept than a complete game, but it lays the foundation for potential future development.

## Features

### 1. Scoring System

- Tracks the player's score based on time elapsed, player health, and the percentage of burnt rock.
- Updates the score during the game and adds points on specific events.

### 2. UI Display

- Shows percentages of burnt rock, tree/grass, and alight cells.
- Displays the player's score, time, and health points (HP) on the user interface.

### 3. Gun and Enemy Interactions

- Handles bullet collisions with enemies.
- Manages the player's health, decreasing it when in contact with fire, and triggering a game over if health reaches zero.

## Usage

1. Open the project in Unity.
2. Explore the scenes and scripts to understand the implementation.
3. Run the simulation to see the forest fire spread and interact with the player.

## Known Issues

- This version is unpolished and may contain bugs.
- It is a proof of concept rather than a fully polished game.
